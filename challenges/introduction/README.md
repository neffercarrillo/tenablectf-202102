Welcome and thanks for playing the Tenable Community CTF!

For those that are unaware, a CTF (capture the flag) is an information security-based competition focused on solving a variety of challenges. These challenges typically involve some amount of puzzle solving, reverse engineering, web security, cryptography, etc. More information can be found here: https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/. For those newer to these types of competitions, see the following guide for a brief introduction: https://trailofbits.github.io/ctf/.

For this CTF, unless otherwise stated in the challenge text, all flags will be in the format of "flag{some_clever_text}." For example, the solution to this challenge is:

flag{some_clever_text}
